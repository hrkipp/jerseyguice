Example
The only thing you need to change in your current JAX RS provider is to annotate them with @JerseyGuiceManaged like below. For guice details, please check the guice documentation
{{{
@Path("/test")
@JerseyGuiceManaged(module=GuiceInjector.class)
public class ExampleService {
    @Inject
    Service myService;
    ....
    ...
}

}}}
The GuiceInjector looks like this:

{{{
public class GuiceInjector extends AbstractModule {
    protected void configure() {
        bind(Service.class).to(ServiceImpl.class).in(Singleton.class);
    }
}

}}}
